      <h2>Stage 3 - Anaphase</h2>
      <p>
        In anaphase, the sister chromatids separate from each other and are pulled towards opposite ends of the cell.

          <ul>
            <li>The protein “glue” that holds the sister chromatids together is broken down, allowing them to separate. Each is now its own chromosome. The chromosomes of each pair are pulled towards opposite ends of the cell.</li>
            <li>Microtubules not attached to chromosomes elongate and push apart, separating the poles and making the cell longer.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>All of these processes are driven by motor proteins, molecular machines that can “walk” along microtubule tracks and carry a cargo. In mitosis, motor proteins carry chromosomes or other microtubules as they walk.
