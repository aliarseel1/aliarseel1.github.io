      <h2>Stage 2 - Metaphase</h2>
      <p>
        In metaphase, the spindle has captured all the chromosomes and lined them up at the middle of the cell, ready to divide.
      </p>

      <div class="half">
        <div class="container">
          <ul>
            <li>All the chromosomes align at the metaphase plate (not a physical structure, just a term for the plane where the chromosomes line up)</li>
            <li>At this stage, the two kinetochores of each chromosome should be attached to microtubules from opposite spindle poles</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Before proceeding to anaphase, the cell will check to make sure that all the chromosomes are at the metaphase plate with their kinetochores correctly attached to microtubules. This is called the spindle checkpoint and helps ensure that the sister chromatids will split evenly between the two daughter cells when they separate in the next step. If a chromosome is not properly aligned or attached, the cell will halt division until the problem is fixed.
